## 1Ô∏è‚É£ One-Time Setup (Do This First!)

You **must** complete these two parts **one time** before you can use the app.

### üêç Part 1: Install Python (If you don't have it)

> (If you already have Python 3, you can skip to Part 2!)

1.  Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  Download the latest Python 3 installer.
3.  Run the installer.
4.  ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERY IMPORTANT (for Windows):** On the first screen of the installer, **check the box** that says "**Add Python to PATH**". This is crucial for the app to work.
    

### üì¶ Part 2: Install Project Requirements (MANDATORY)

This is the most important step. You must do this *after* installing Python but *before* running the app for the first time.

1.  **Get the Project Folder**
    * You should have a folder named `LocalShare-Project` (or similar) that contains all the app files (`run.bat`, `requirements.txt`, etc.).
    * Place this folder somewhere permanent, like your **Desktop** or **Documents**.

2.  **Open a Terminal INSIDE That Folder**
    * You must run the next command *inside* the project folder. Here‚Äôs how:
    * **Windows:**
        * **Method A (Easiest):** Open the `LocalShare-Project` folder in File Explorer. Click in the empty space of the address bar at the top, type `cmd`, and press **Enter**.
        * **Method B:** Right-click inside the `LocalShare-Project` folder and select **"Open in Terminal"** (this option is available in Windows 11 or with Windows Terminal installed).
    * **Mac/Linux:** Right-click inside the `LocalShare-Project` folder and choose **"Open in Terminal"**.

3.  **Install the Libraries**
    * A terminal window will now be open, and its path should be inside your `LocalShare-Project` folder.
    * Type (or copy-paste) this exact command and press **Enter**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    * Wait for it to finish installing. [cite_start]You will see it downloading packages like `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `qrcode`, etc. [cite: 1]
    * Once it's done, you can close this terminal window.

### üéâ Setup is complete! You only need to do this once. üéâ

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to Share (Day-to-Day Use)

Now for the easy part!

### ÓÅûÔΩ™ On Windows (Easiest Way)

1.  Navigate to your `LocalShare-Project` folder.
2.  **Double-click** the `run.bat` file.
3.  A new black window will open, asking for the folder path.
4.  Open a *different* File Explorer window and find the folder you wish to share.
5.  **Drag that folder** from File Explorer and **drop it directly into the black terminal window**. The folder's path will appear automatically.

6.  Press **Enter**.
7.  The app will start! It will show a **QR code** in the terminal and automatically open the sharing page in your web browser.
8.  Scan the QR code with your phone (or other device) to access the files!

### ÓÅûÂÖãÓÅûÂà∂ On Mac / Linux

1.  Open your regular terminal.
2.  `cd` into your `LocalShare-Project` folder.
    * *Example: `cd ~/Desktop/LocalShare-Project`*
3.  (First time only) Make the script executable. Type: `chmod +x run.sh`
4.  Run the script by typing:
    * `./run.sh`
5.  The script will prompt you for the folder path.
6.  Open your file manager and find the folder you want to share.
7.  **Drag the folder** from the file manager and **drop it into the terminal window**. The path will appear.
8.  Press **Enter**.
9.  The terminal will show the QR code. Scan it with your phone to connect!

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Stop Sharing

When you are finished sharing, just go back to the **black terminal window** (the one showing the QR code).

1.  Press **Ctrl+C** (hold the Ctrl key and press C).
2.  **Close the terminal window.**

That's it! The server will shut down.
